At each iteration, the index i is assigned to the next item in the range object, the i-th element in lst is accessed, then that element is compared to val. All three of these actions take a constant amount of time to execute. Therefore, since these three instructions are executed a total of n times, linear_search is $O(n)$. See [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/big-o-notation) for some other examples.\n",

Because of how your data ingestion tool splits your fidget spinner transaction data into partitions to process it more quickly, not all of your data you receive is in order. Your robot boss Bubbles wants to use bubble sort to keep 10+ billion transactions in order. You want to persuade Bubbles to not use bubble sort. Because of your experience as a data scientist before the AI takeover, you believe that you can create a clear visualization like the one below to persuade Bubbles.\n",
